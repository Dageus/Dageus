## About Me

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at IST (Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico), in Lisbon, Portugal.

I have a passion for Cybersecurity, trying to participate in as many CTF's as I can, and learning as much as possible about the subject.

I also play piano for about 8 years, and have a passion for music in general.
